## EdgeR test

The separation of the TN treatment in the PCA (@fig-PCA) incited the question of whether this separation could partly be explained by an interaction effect between temperature and nutrients. To this end a permanova was performed following the 2x2 factorial design of temperature and nutrients. The test revealed significant effects of both temperature and nutrients alone, and the significant interaction effect, further corroborating the cluster positions seen in the PCA. To investigate the effect of nutrient addition on microbial community gene expression at different temperature regimes, the edgeR analysis included the following contrasts:\
$N - C$\
$TN - T$\
$(TN - T) - (N - C)$\
The last being the interaction effect between temperature and nutrients.\

It seems that there are quite some genes which are differentially expressed between the contrasts, but as a fraction they are not that many. The interaction effect focus should be on the upregulated part of genes, these are either higher or lower in the C and TN treatments, and are rather few. This is in line with the permanova which showed a weak (albeit significant) interaction effect. For the LogFC vs LOGCPM relationship of the genes, see @fig-contrast_plot.

Comparing the responses of individual genes to nutrient addition at different temperature regimes would be too extensive due to the number of genes that are differentially expressed. Instead the tpm-values for the genes were summarised under the broader [COG-categories](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/cog#){target="_blank"}. These categories were then ranked in order of prominence for the two contrasts $N - C$ and $TN - T$ to compare differences in functional response to nutrient additions at the different temperature regimes. **Results showed differential response on the COG-functional level** as seen in @fig-contrasts.

![COG category responses](../results/contrasts_COG.png){#fig-contrasts}

The treatments without nutrient additions had different categories that were upregulated (P in the C-treatment and "-" in the TN treatment), suggesting different gene repertoires being expressed between communities, and a set of genes that are more abundant in the lower nutrient treatments. Furthermore, the "-" means that many eggnogs were not belonging to any category, and shows a higher abundance of eggnogs without a COG-caterogy in the cold treatments (C,N) as compared to the warm treatments. It should be noted that the response of differentially expressed genes to nutrient addition was in general stronger in the NvsC contrast as compared to the TNvsT contrast in terms of ... . Although the communities are different, the 5 COG-categories that were most upregulated (tpm) in response to nutrient addition were the **same in both temperature regimes (J,S,C,E,I)**, showing a unified response regardless of different communities. On the other hand the G and T categories had a large difference in abundance ranking between the two nutrient responses, being more prominent in the CvsN-response as compared to the TN. In the TN-response M, K and O instead played a more important role.

## Rank-abundance of up and downregulated genes per contrast

The next step was to identify the abundance of the + eggNOGs in the respective treatment and contrast, to understand if they were important in shaping community expression (on the assumption that abundance = importance). This was done by plotting the top100 genes in each treatment (@fig-rank_abundance_significant_genes). The first thing to note is that the slope between the most abundant + genes varies between contrasts. The highest slope is noted in the NvsC-contrast, where the tpm also stays above 50 for the lowest ranked eggNOG, while the subpanels then reach a steeper slope and lower abundance sequentially.

## Interaction effect

The interaction effect can not separate between whether they are up or downregulated in a specific treatment, instead it highlights either high in C or TN treatments (@fig-interaction_upregulated_genes). So a further filtering criterion needs to be performed to specialize on the TN-treatment. This should be done by filtering out each eggnog with a max-value in the TN treatment! By this definition all the max-values of each eggnog should belong either to the C or TN treatment for the interaction effect to be correct however this was not the case, until a filtering criterion of 5 tpm was added.

```{r}
#| label: fig-interaction_upregulated_genes

On the other hand, the downregulated genes instead has optima in the N-treatment, and most likely the T treatment as well, but among the 50 most abundant in this contrast, the peak abundance is observed in the N-treatment (@fig-interaction_downregulated_genes).

### Checking that the max values are only in C or TN treatment to validate interaction effect.

After applying a filtering criteria of minimum 5 tpm for each eggnog, this assumption holds true when summarising the max-value for each eggnog and treatment. Using this filter, 29 are upregulated in the C-tratment, while in TN 104 eggNOGs are upregulated due to the interaction effect of temperature and nutrients (@tbl-filter). However, Jarone, I am waiting for prokka annotation, which hopefully will provide better coverage on the genenames, as compared to the eggnog-mapper. So don't get caught in the functions too deeply.

After some thinking and discussing,the downregulated genes should perhaps have their minimum value in the C or TN treatment. That is not entirely the case (@tbl-filter_output), but it is noted that the majority of downregulated genes have their minimum in the TN-treatment.

To further expand on the upregulated eggnogs a table to identify the functions they encode was created (@tbl-enoglegends2). The first thee genes (alphabetically) may be involved in amino acid metabolism, however there are contrasting entries in swissprot so I can not tell for sure. *BioB* a gene involved in biotin biosynthesis is also in the list. While not creating a long list of genes this time, a quick skim reveals many genes related to amino acid and protein metabolism, as well as ribosomal protein encoding genes (the rp-prefix). Some transcriptional controlling genes are also thrown in the mix among others.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-enoglegends2

  ) %>% DT::formatStyle(columns = colnames(df), fontSize = '150%')
```

After a quick look at the function of the genes, a pertinent question to answer is, how much of the treatment-specific expression are the genes responsible for in the respective treatment (tpm)? Interestingly the tpm values for a few genes are high in the C-treatment (@fig-upregulated_interact_enogs). Do note that all the unannotated genes (or "-") are lumped into one category here (hence the low number of genes in the C-treatment), I still need to investigate whether ggplot takes the sum or means of all tpm values. On a first glance, groSL pops up in the C-treatment, these are chaperonins.

## The most abundant logFC genes in respective contrast, how are they different?

Before diving into the most diferentially expressed eNOGs, it is worthwile looking at the most abundant eNOGs in each treatment. Interestingly, the 50 most abundant genes are non-differentially expressed, with the excpetion of one (@fig-contrasts_abundant_genes). In contrast, 10 out of the 50 most abundant genes in the TNvsT contrast is instead significantly downregulated, and a similar pattern is seen for the interaction (@fig-contrasts_abundant_genes). This indicates that there are, in the NvsC-contrast, several highly abundant genes which are not effected by the nutrient addition. While the the differential expression in the TNvsT and interaction contrasts instead have a higher proportion of highly abundant genes which are differentially expressed, but in large the same pattern of abundant non-DE genes is seen, meaning that several abundant genes are responsible for functional similarity between the contrasts.

## How much of the community function is shared (number of enogs present in each treatment)

To further identify the importance of a differential expression analysis the number of eNOGS in each treatment is compared to see how functionally different the communities are per treatment. Interestingly, the unique enogs for the N-treatment is very high (@fig-shared_enogs), meaning that a differential expression analysis most likely yields a higher number of DE-enogs simply because the communities are functionally different, meaning that it is **non-shared genes that drive the changes.** Interestingly the shared genes between TN and T, as well as TN and N, indicate that roughly the same fraction of genes are shared uniquely for these, apart from the genes shared by all treatments, and the least amount of unique genes is found in the TN-treatment. This suggests that the changes as seen in the other treatments (for example @fig-PCA) is more likely to be explained by differential expression of a larger fraction of shared genes i.e **the shared genes in these contrasts drive the changes** (This needs to be verified by splitting the DE-fraction into shared and non-shared genes). Another interesting thing to note, is that functional richness (number of eggnogs) is highest in the N-treatment, followed by C, T and TN. This suggests that in the TN-treatment, functional richness is low, and community expression dominated by a smaller subset of functions. (**verify this with alpha diversity measurements**).

To further put @fig-shared_enogs into perspective, it is trying to convey that the functional repertoire has an overlap (presence absence), but the less the communities overlap funtionally, the more genes will be differentially expressed due to a 0 count vs any number higher than 0 counts comparison. The underlying assumption here being that the number of significantly differently expressed eNOGs should be influenced by community differences such that the number of differential genes should increase with distance in community function. This was tested by calculating bray-curtis distances based on the average tpm for all gene functions per treatment. This approach of using the mean might obscure the relationship a bit by removing replicates. Regardless, a positive relationship is seen, with some variation (@fig-ComDistVsDEGenes), the correlation coefficient indicates a strong relationship, but the observations are few. An alternative approach was to make the number of DE-genes expressed per treatment fractional and run a linear model, this shows a slope of 0.1, (@fig-ComDistVsDEGenes) (Is it correct to run a linear model on fractions?).

```{r}
#| label: ComDistVsDEGenesPreparation

#In this chunk, plot distances between contrasts and compare the number of DE-genes, should show a positive relationship. The-DE gene analysis is done again, and fdr values recalculated, then everything is plotted against the DE-gene numbers. Ask Daniel if this is the way to go, or if this should be done in the original DE-gene analysis and, if so this will inflate the family-wise error. Do the comparison only for day 10, as performed in the DE-tests.

# Contrasts to compare - CvsN, CvsT, CvsTN, TvsN, TvsTN, NvsTN. For the DE-genes this is already given, all DE-genes should be plotted, negative and positive together.

Finally, in a pedagogically backwards fashion. To elucidate if the shared genes are relevant this graph sums up the total tpm of the upregulated genes in each contrast, to see if they are responsible for a large fraction of the community expression. Comparing the tpm of the NvsC contrast, it is clear to see that the majority of gene expression is explained by the non-differential fraction of genes (@fig-contrast_enogTpm). The same relationship is repeated in the TNvsT-contrast, with the difference that the tpm explained by the genes involved in the analyses is roughly half.
