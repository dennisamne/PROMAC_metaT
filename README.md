### Project description
A mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of nutrients (yeast extract) and temperature on prokaryotic maintenance respiration, growth efficiency and other prokaryotic variables such as community composition and gene expression. The treatments were divided into a control (1 C, no nutrient addition) Temperature increase (10 C), N (nutrient addition), TN (temperature and nutrient addition). The experiment was initiated on March 5<sup>th</sup> 2020, and concluded a month later on April 2<sup>nd</sup> , sampling was performed twice per week. From a selection based on maintenance respiration and growth rates, gene expression was sequenced for all treatments during timepoints 3 and 5 (days 10 (2020/03/16 and 17 (2020/03/23). Gene expression was then investigated to understand community responses to different temperature and nutrient regimes.
